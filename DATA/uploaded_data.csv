She braces herself as thoughts flash through her mind. The shocking thing is, the thoughts are not of her husband, but a man she last saw fifteen years ago: Wyatt Armstrong.

Dawn, miraculously, survives the crash, but so do all the doubts that have suddenly been raised. She has led a good life. Back in Boston, there is her husband, Brian, her beloved daughter, and her work as a death doula, where she helps ease the transition between life and death for patients in hospice.

But somewhere in Egypt is Wyatt Armstrong, who works as an archaeologist unearthing ancient burial sites, a job she once studied for, but was forced to abandon when life suddenly intervened. And now, when it seems that fate is offering her second chances, she is not as sure of the choice she once made.

After the crash landing, the airline ensures the survivors are seen by a doctor, then offers transportation wherever they want to go. The obvious option for Dawn is to continue down the path she is on and go home to her family. The other is to return to the archaeological site she left years before, reconnect with Wyatt and their unresolved history, and maybe even complete her research on The Book of Two Ways--the first known map of the afterlife.

As the story unfolds, Dawn's two possible futures unspool side by side, as do the secrets and doubts long buried beside them. Dawn must confront the questions she's never truly asked: What does a life well-lived look like? When we leave this earth, what do we leave behind? Do we make choices...or do our choices make us?

Those who earn a place among the Alexandrians will secure a life of wealth, power, and prestige beyond their wildest dreams, and each decade, only the six most uniquely talented magicians are selected to be considered for initiation.

Enter the latest round of six: Libby Rhodes and Nico de Varona, unwilling halves of an unfathomable whole, who exert uncanny control over every element of physicality. Reina Mori, a naturalist, who can intuit the language of life itself. Parisa Kamali, a telepath who can traverse the depths of the subconscious, navigating worlds inside the human mind. Callum Nova, an empath easily mistaken for a manipulative illusionist, who can influence the intimate workings of a person?s inner self. Finally, there is Tristan Caine, who can see through illusions to a new structure of reality?an ability so rare that neither he nor his peers can fully grasp its implications.

When the candidates are recruited by the mysterious Atlas Blakely, they are told they will have one year to qualify for initiation, during which time they will be permitted preliminary access to the Society?s archives and judged based on their contributions to various subjects of impossibility: time and space, luck and thought, life and death. Five, they are told, will be initiated. One will be eliminated. The six potential initiates will fight to survive the next year of their lives, and if they can prove themselves to be the best among their rivals, most of them will.

A Brief History of Timekeeping,Chad Orzel,Science,"Predating written language and marching on through human history, the desire for ever-better timekeeping has spurred technological innovation and sparked theories that radically reshaped our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Chad Orzel, a physicist and bestselling author, continues his tradition of demystifying thorny scientific concepts by using the clocks and calendars central to our everyday activities as a jumping-off point to explore the science underlying the ways we keep track of our time. Ancient solstice markers depend on the basic astrophysics of our solar system; mechanical clocks owe their development to Newtonian physics; and the ultra-precise atomic timekeeping that enables GPS hinges on the predictable oddities of quantum mechanics. Along the way, Orzel visits the delicate negotiations involved in Gregorian calendar reform, the intricate and entirely unique system employed by the Maya, and how the problem of synchronizing clocks at different locations ultimately required us to abandon the idea of time as an absolute and universal quantity. Sharp and engaging, A Brief History of Timekeeping is a story not just about the science of sundials, sandglasses, and mechanical clocks, but also the politics of calendars and time zones, the philosophy of measurement, and the nature of space and time itself.",400,70,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1628364152i/58721072.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669907/ebooks/ed2gnvhf78ijxxts4klo.jpg
A Briefer History of Time,Leonard Mlodinow and Stephen Hawking,Science,"Stephen Hawking's worldwide bestseller, A Brief History of Time, has been a landmark volume in scientific writing. Its author's engaging voice is one reason, and the compelling subjects he addresses is another; the nature of space and time, the role of God in creation, the history and future of the universe. But it is also true that in the years since its publication, readers have repeatedly told Professor Hawking of their great difficulty in understanding some of the book's most important concepts.

This is the origin of and the reason for A Briefer History of Time: its author's wish to make its content more accessible to readers - as well as to bring it up-to-date with the latest scientific observations and findings.

Although this book is literally somewhat ""briefer"", it actually expands on the great subjects of the original. Purely technical concepts, such as the mathematics of chaotic boundary conditions, are gone. Conversely, subjects of wide interest that were difficult to follow because they were interspersed throughout the book have now been given entire chapters of their own, including relativity, curved space, and quantum theory.

This reorganization has allowed the authors to expand areas of special interest and recent progress, from the latest developments in string theory to exciting developments in the search for a complete unified theory of all the forces of physics. Like prior editions of the book - but even more so - A Briefer History of Time will guide nonscientists everywhere in the ongoing search for the tantalizing secrets at the heart of time and space.

Thirty-seven full-color illustrations enhance the text and make A Briefer History of Time an exhilarating addition in its own right to the literature of science.",300,70,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924782i/2094.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669908/ebooks/alhmjhshk3odpu94cs7e.jpg
Entangled Life,Merlin Sheldrake,Science,"There is a lifeform so strange and wondrous that it forces us to rethink how life works?

Neither plant nor animal, it is found throughout the earth, the air and our bodies. It can be microscopic, yet also accounts for the largest organisms ever recorded, living for millennia and weighing tens of thousands of tonnes. Its ability to digest rock enabled the first life on land, it can survive unprotected in space, and thrives amidst nuclear radiation.

In this captivating adventure, Merlin Sheldrake explores the spectacular and neglected world of fungi: endlessly surprising organisms that sustain nearly all living systems. They can solve problems without a brain, stretching traditional definitions of ?intelligence?, and can manipulate animal behaviour with devastating precision. In giving us bread, alcohol and life-saving medicines, fungi have shaped human history, and their psychedelic properties, which have influenced societies since antiquity, have recently been shown to alleviate a number of mental illnesses. The ability of fungi to digest plastic, explosives, pesticides and crude oil is being harnessed in break-through technologies, and the discovery that they connect plants in underground networks, the ?Wood Wide Web?, is transforming the way we understand ecosystems. Yet they live their lives largely out of sight, and over ninety percent of their species remain undocumented.

Entangled Life is a mind-altering journey into this hidden kingdom of life, and shows that fungi are key to understanding the planet on which we live, and the ways we think, feel and behave. The more we learn about fungi, the less makes sense without them.",300,70,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1575341220l/52668915.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669909/ebooks/arkninnbsli4rznl8wew.jpg
The Next 500 Years,Christopher E. Mason,Science,"An argument that we have a moral duty to explore other planets and solar systems--because human life on Earth has an expiration date.

Inevitably, life on Earth will come to an end, whether by climate disaster, cataclysmic war, or the death of the sun in a few billion years. To avoid extinction, we will have to find a new home planet, perhaps even a new solar system, to inhabit. In this provocative and fascinating book, Christopher Mason argues that we have a moral duty to do just that. As the only species aware that life on Earth has an expiration date, we have a responsibility to act as the shepherd of life-forms--not only for our species but for all species on which we depend and for those still to come (by accidental or designed evolution). Mason argues that the same capacity for ingenuity that has enabled us to build rockets and land on other planets can be applied to redesigning biology so that we can sustainably inhabit those planets. And he lays out a 500-year plan for undertaking the massively ambitious project of reengineering human genetics for life on other worlds.

As they are today, our frail human bodies could never survive travel to another habitable planet. Mason describes the toll that long-term space travel took on astronaut Scott Kelly, who returned from a year on the International Space Station with changes to his blood, bones, and genes. Mason proposes a ten-phase, 500-year program that would engineer the genome so that humans can tolerate the extreme environments of outer space--with the ultimate goal of achieving human settlement of new solar systems. He lays out a roadmap of which solar systems to visit first, and merges biotechnology, philosophy, and genetics to offer an unparalleled vision of the universe to come.",350,30,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1617998263i/57196561.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669910/ebooks/j036xqyddnpidbf8q9mw.jpg
Under a White Sky,Elizabeth Kolbert,Science,"The Pulitzer Prize?winning author of The Sixth Extinction returns to humanity?s transformative impact on the environment, now asking: After doing so much damage, can we change nature, this time to save it?

That man should have dominion ?over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth? is a prophecy that has hardened into fact. So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it?s said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene.

In Under a White Sky, Elizabeth Kolbert takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. She meets scientists who are trying to preserve the world?s rarest fish, which lives in a single, tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave. She visits a lava field in Iceland, where engineers are turning carbon emissions to stone; an aquarium in Australia, where researchers are trying to develop ?super coral? that can survive on a hotter globe; and a lab at Harvard, where physicists are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere in order to reflect sunlight back to space and cool the earth.

One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, Under a White Sky is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.",250,25,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1608039192i/54814834.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669911/ebooks/ebldkhowabkajrruxvhk.jpg
How to Make a Vaccine,John Rhodes,Science,"Distinguished expert in vaccine development John Rhodes tells the story of the first approved COVID-19 vaccines and offers an essential, up-to-the-minute primer on how scientists discover, test, and distribute vaccines.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has affected every corner of the world, changing our relationship to our communities, to our jobs, and to each other, the most pressing question has been?when will it end? Researchers around the globe are urgently trying to answer this question by racing to test and distribute a vaccine that could end the greatest public health threat of our time. In How to Make a Vaccine, an expert who has firsthand experience developing vaccines tells an optimistic story of how three hundred years of vaccine discovery and a century and a half of immunology research have come together at this powerful moment?and will lead to multiple COVID-19 vaccines.

Dr. John Rhodes draws on his experience as an immunologist, including working alongside a young Anthony Fauci, to unravel the mystery of how vaccines are designed, tested, and produced at scale for global deployment. Concise and accessible, this book describes in everyday language how the immune system evolved to combat infection, how viruses responded by evolving ways to evade our defenses, and how vaccines do their work. That history, and the pace of current research developments, make Rhodes hopeful that multiple vaccines will protect us. Today the complex workings of the immune system are well understood. The tools needed by biomedical scientists stand ready to be used, and more than 160 vaccine candidates have already been produced. But defeating COVID-19 won?t be the end of the Rhodes describes how discoveries today are also empowering scientists to combat future threats to global health, including a recent breakthrough in the development of genetic vaccines, which have never before been used in humans.

As the world prepares for a vaccine, Rhodes offers a current and informative look at the science and strategies that deliver solutions to the crisis.",350,30,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1607881588i/55829022.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669914/ebooks/ob8tbs1lc0i0sprrveas.jpg
Until the End of Time,Brian Greene,Science,"From the world-renowned physicist and bestselling author of The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos, a captivating exploration of deep time and humanity's search for purpose

In both time and space, the cosmos is astoundingly vast, and yet is governed by simple, elegant, universal mathematical laws.

On this cosmic timeline, our human era is spectacular but fleeting. Someday, we know, we will all die. And, we know, so too will the universe itself.

Until the End of Time is Brian Greene's breathtaking new exploration of the cosmos and our quest to understand it. Greene takes us on a journey across time, from our most refined understanding of the universe's beginning, to the closest science can take us to the very end. He explores how life and mind emerged from the initial chaos, and how our minds, in coming to understand their own impermanence, seek in different ways to give meaning to experience: in story, myth, religion, creative expression, science, the quest for truth, and our longing for the timeless, or eternal. Through a series of nested stories that explain distinct but interwoven layers of reality-from the quantum mechanics to consciousness to black holes-Greene provides us with a clearer sense of how we came to be, a finer picture of where we are now, and a firmer understanding of where we are headed.

Yet all this understanding, which arose with the emergence of life, will dissolve with its conclusion. Which leaves us with one realization: during our brief moment in the sun, we are tasked with the charge of finding our own meaning.

Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,Trevor Noah,Comedy,"The memoir of one man?s coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed.

Trevor Noah?s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents? indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa?s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.

Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man?s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother?his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.",400,25,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473867911i/29780253.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669955/ebooks/n38ozdkw4hljsfcpw32w.jpg
Bossypants,Tina Fey,Comedy,"Before Liz Lemon, before ""Weekend Update,"" before ""Sarah Palin,"" Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.

She has seen both these dreams come true.

At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on Saturday Night Live; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon?from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.

Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.",350,75,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1481509554i/9418327.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669957/ebooks/gsif4kasiv3wue180jpv.jpg
Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?,Mindy Kaling,Comedy,"Mindy Kaling has lived many lives: the obedient child of immigrant professionals, a timid chubster afraid of her own bike, a Ben Affleck - impersonating Off-Broadway performer and playwright, and, finally, a comedy writer and actress prone to starting fights with her friends and coworkers with the sentence ""Can I just say one last thing about this, and then I swear I'll shut up about it?""

Perhaps you want to know what Mindy thinks makes a great best friend (someone who will fill your prescription in the middle of the night), or what makes a great guy (one who is aware of all elderly people in any room at any time and acts accordingly), or what is the perfect amount of fame (so famous you can never get convicted of murder in a court of law), or how to maintain a trim figure (you will not find that information in these pages). If so, you've come to the right book, mostly!

In Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy invites readers on a tour of her life and her unscientific observations on romance, friendship, and Hollywood, with several conveniently placed stopping points for you to run errands and make phone calls. Mindy Kaling really is just a Girl Next Door - not so much literally anywhere in the continental United States, but definitely if you live in India or Sri Lanka.",300,15,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1443264638i/10335308.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669959/ebooks/vmgfauzftd5lniv9vdfx.jpg
Why Not Me?,Mindy Kaling,Comedy,"From the author of the beloved New York Times bestselling book Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? and the creator and star of The Mindy Project comes a collection of essays that are as hilarious and insightful as they are deeply personal.

In Why Not Me?, Kaling shares her ongoing journey to find contentment and excitement in her adult life, whether it's falling in love at work, seeking new friendships in lonely places, attempting to be the first person in history to lose weight without any behavior modification whatsoever, or most important, believing that you have a place in Hollywood when you're constantly reminded that no one looks like you.
In ""How to Look Spectacular: A Starlet's Confessions"", Kaling gives her tongue-in-cheek secrets for surefire on-camera beauty, (""Your natural hair color may be appropriate for your skin tone, but this isn't the land of appropriate-this is Hollywood, baby. Out here, a dark-skinned woman s traditional hair color is honey blonde."") ""Player"" tells the story of Kaling being seduced and dumped by a female friend in L.A. (""I had been replaced by a younger model. And now they had matching bangs."") In ""Unlikely Leading Lady"", she muses on America's fixation with the weight of actresses, (""Most women we see onscreen are either so thin that they're walking clavicles or so huge that their only scenes involve them breaking furniture."") And in ""Soup Snakes"", Kaling spills some secrets on her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and close friend, B.J. Novak (""I will freely admit: my relationship with B.J. Novak is weird as hell."")
Mindy turns the anxieties, the glamour, and the celebrations of her second coming-of-age into a laugh-out-loud funny collection of essays that anyone who's ever been at a turning point in their life or career can relate to. And those who've never been at a turning point can skip to the parts where she talks about meeting Bradley Cooper.",200,25,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473956249i/30268522.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669961/ebooks/ifxycmv3onag91felcxa.jpg

Twenty-six-year-old editorial assistant Nella Rogers is tired of being the only Black employee at Wagner Books.

Then the notes begin to appear on Nella?s desk: LEAVE WAGNER. NOW.

Alpha Max: An Existential Romp through an Absurd Multiverse,Mark A. Rayner,Comedy,"????? ""Funny, yet deep, this is definitely worth venturing into the multiverse for.""Amazing Stories ""Snarky as Pratchet, insightful as Stephenson, as full of scathing social commentary as Swift or Voltaire, and weirdly reminiscent of LeGuin, Alpha Max is the only multiverse novel you need this month, or maybe ever.""Maximilian Tundra is about to have an existential crisis of cosmic proportions.

When a physical duplicate of him appears in his living room, wearing a tight-fitting silver lam‚ unitard and speaking with an English accent, Max knows something bad is about to happen. Bad doesn?t cover it. Max discovers he?s the only human being who can prevent the end of the world, and not just on his planet! In the multiverse, infinite Earths will be destroyed.

Personally, Max thinks the multiverse is in big trouble, because he can?t even keep his toenails clipped on the regular, let alone stop the apocalypse. His only ?allies? are a race of manic pixie aliens and dozens of other versions of himself; and let?s face it, both groups are annoying as heck!

From award-winning author Mark A. Rayner, Alpha Max is a silly and serious spoof of the science fiction and superhero movie trope of multiple realities. Fans of the humorous science fiction of Douglas Adams and the black humor and satire of Kurt Vonnegut will love this dark comedy that will make you think as well as laugh.

Blowing up the Airwaves: An Adventure on the Radio,Chris Wright,Comedy,"The fictional Brad and Bone Morning Show is non-stop fun on the radio. But when Brad starts wanting more out of life, does the fun have to stop? It may not matter if they can?t find the mysterious listener who has explosive plans for the football stadium.

Blowing up the Airwaves is your backstage pass inside the studio and the personal lives of an over-the-top radio show. Are the people you hear every morning really the great friends they seem to be, or is it all an act? Sometimes they have to ask themselves that very question. Even after four hours of conversation five days a week for decades, the most important things can still be left unsaid. And that can cause more drama off mic than anything that happens on the air.

Strap yourself in for a wild ride. This roller coaster has everything from blackmail in the workplace to an exploding bass boat. A howler monkey and a giant catapult. A good ole boy who loves to blow stuff up. Even a Smokey and the Bandit style Trans-Am with an anatomically correct Firebird.

As radio consultants often tell their morning show teams, ""They like you because you make them laugh. They love you because you make them cry."" Brad and Bone will definitely have you laughing. If you cry a little, too... well, we won't tell anybody.",250,15,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1641923343i/60104604.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669969/ebooks/jfitgzox5y3uokmy2u0j.jpg

- Design your environment to make success easier;
- Get back on track when you fall off course;
...and much more.

The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,Charles Duhigg,self-help,"A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.

Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern?and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.

An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees?how they approach worker safety?and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.

What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives.

They succeeded by transforming habits.

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.

Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren?s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation?s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.

At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.

Habits aren?t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.",250,25,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1545854312i/12609433.jpg,https://res.cloudinary.com/dyzgdedd4/image/upload/v1726669975/ebooks/pe7w56kdluhecehhwrri.jpg
